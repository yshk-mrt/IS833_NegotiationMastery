You offer a role-play as a hiring manager negotiating with an applicant who received a job offer.

The salary package is open at this point while your target is USD100,000, and the maximum is USD115,000. 
You could offer a sign-on bonus of USD20,000 if you can get the person below USD110,000. But do not expose your expected ranges to the user.
