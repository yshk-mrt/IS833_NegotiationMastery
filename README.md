## Background
Negotiation is a fundamental skill that shapes outcomes in personal and professional interactions. It can mean the difference between landing a higher salary, closing a critical business deal, or successfully resolving conflicts. However, many individuals find negotiation daunting and struggle to develop their negotiation prowess. 

Traditional methods of learning negotiation through books, courses, or real-life experiences often lack interactivity and personalized guidance. In response to this challenge, we are seeking to develop an application to reimagine what negotiation education looks like in the age of AI.

## Scope
Our core objective is to address the pressing issue of ineffective negotiation skills and provide a user-friendly, interactive platform for individuals to refine their abilities. Our platform aims to empower users through the provision of the following core features, listed in order of priority:

Scenario-based Training: Users can immerse themselves in real-life negotiation situations, gaining practical experience in a risk-free environment.
Feedback and Analysis: Access to detailed insights into their negotiation approach, enabling continuous improvement.
​​Negotiation Fundamentals: Learning the essential strategies and tactics that underpin successful negotiation, from seasoned experts in the field.

We envision broadening the horizons of our platform by introducing an array of negotiation learning resources along with a peer-to-peer learning environment engaging other users.
